## TODO 

   - [x] sanatize data (duplicate address, valid address, add up amount)
  - [x] the 3 functions needed are add up all amounts, check for validity of address and uniqueness of address
  - [x] and probably should take all amounts and times them by 18 somewhere?
  - [x] upload to S3
  - [x] add address and amount to env and/or json and pipe into deploy task 
  - [x] test sanatize data 


  ## Flow
